A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a specific type of artificial neural network that uses perceptrons, a machine learning unit algorithm, for supervised learning, to analyze data. CNNs apply to image processing, natural language processing and other kinds of cognitive tasks.Like other kinds of artificial neural networks, a convolutional neural network has an input layer, an output layer and various hidden layers. Some of these layers are convolutional, using a mathematical model to pass on results to successive layers. This simulates some of the actions in the human visual cortex.
